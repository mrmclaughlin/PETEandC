        <h1>Teaching Math with XR</h1>
        <p>The proposed session will provide teaching tips and practices to create XR-based lessons to enhance Math instruction. Topics will include CreatiCode, Blender, and Geogebra. Mathematics is the language we use to explain our universe. XR allows students to develop that language in a very real way. Included grade levels 6 - 12 and a resource download.</p>
